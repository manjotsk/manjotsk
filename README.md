# 👋 Hi, I’m Manjot Singh — a Full-Stack Developer, Tech Architect & Problem Solver

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m Manjot, a developer who builds fast, scalable, and practical software systems. Whether it’s a hospital SaaS app generating EMRs from voice, or a logistics platform matching shippers with carriers, I bring ideas to life with **clean code, scalable architecture, and thoughtful UX**.

---

## 🚀 Who Am I?

I’m a **MERN stack developer** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), a trainer, an architect, and a builder at heart. With a background in **Computer Engineering (B.E.)** and an **MBA** from **Thapar University**, I merge technical and business thinking to deliver solutions that are as strategic as they are technical.

I lead and contribute to projects where:
- Ideas need translating into MVPs, fast.
- Complex data needs to be tamed (aggregations, pipelines, analytics).
- Speed, scale, and simplicity matter — for both users and developers.

From working on multi-tenant SaaS applications to AI-assisted transcription systems, I bring a hands-on, zero-fluff approach to product building.

## 💼 What I’m Working On

### 🏥 MedFeed – Voice-based Medical Record Generator
> A tablet-first app that allows doctors to narrate medical notes and receive structured EMRs instantly using OpenAI Whisper and GPT-4.  
> Built using React, Tailwind, Node.js, MongoDB, and Python microservices.

- 🔊 Real-time transcription with audio enhancement
- 🧠 Unstructured to structured conversion (doctor's voice → JSON → EMR)
- 🧑‍⚕️ Doctor-first UX with no distractions or unnecessary UI noise
- 🧪 Optimized for speed, used in real hospitals, integrated with local SQL Server

### 📊 Tickmark.io – Productivity & Work Management Suite
> A freemium B2B platform helping companies manage workload, productivity, timesheets, invoices, and more

- ✅ Task, project, lead, and inquiry tracking
- 📈 KPI dashboards with usage analytics & performance scoring
- 🧾 Integrated Razorpay for credit-based features
- 🛠️ Built from scratch with multi-tenant DB architecture (MongoDB per tenant)

### 🚚 Logistics Platform for India-Australia Supply Chains
> Built a freight-matching platform connecting **shippers with loaders** across India and Australia

- 🌏 Geo-targeted shipper onboarding
- 🧮 Real-time load tracking and assignment logic
- 🤝 Human-centered interface for quick quoting and scheduling

## 🧑‍🏫 Teaching & Mentorship

I run a training institute where I teach:
- 🧩 JavaScript (Basics to ES6+)
- 🔗 REST APIs with Express
- 🧠 MongoDB Aggregations
- 📚 Full-stack projects from scratch
- 🎓 Interview preparation for developers

I believe in **"learn by building"**, and that’s how I train my students — with real-world assignments and problems, not just theory.

## 💡 My Development Principles

- **Simplicity scales** – If it’s too clever to understand tomorrow, it’s not worth writing today.
- **Don’t just code. Solve.** – Always begin with the why, then decide the how.
- **Own your product** – From bug fixes to user onboarding, product love matters.
- **Documentation is dev UX** – A well-named function and a clear README can change a team’s velocity.

## 🎯 Some Wins I’m Proud Of

- ⬇️ Reduced 90% infra cost by migrating Azure stack to a secure on-prem setup in China.
- 💸 Integrated credit-based billing with Razorpay and dynamic usage tracking.
- 🏥 Enabled faster EMR workflows in hospitals through audio-to-structured automation.
- 🎯 Built lead scoring systems to auto-follow up and convert 25% more inquiries for businesses.
